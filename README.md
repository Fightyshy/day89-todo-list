# day88-todo-list
A website showcasing a simple, barebones (and most likely buggy) to-do list website using Flask, and a bit of jQuery for AJAX.
Done as part of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 course, [link here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/practice/1251204#overview)

All components required, including a requirements.txt, and a modified todolist.db (generated as part of the assignment) have been included. There is a secret key, but that's just a random set of string used for csrf, and the security risks of deploying the website "as is" to production are understood (CKEditor allowing/saving input as html and a key used for csrf prevention not-withstanding). This will never see production deployment anyway, it's just a portfolio project with a prompt from the course after all.

This project will most likely be polished a bit more, but after another one big one is complete.
